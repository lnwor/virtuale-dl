# virtuale-dl

Extremely simple script to download every file of a course or multiple courses from https://virtuale.unibo.it

### Usage

The script needs the IDs of the courses, session cookies and the path where the
directories will be downloaded. You can either set them from command line with
options or editing the script directly.

```
Usage: ./virtuale-dl.sh [-c COOKIES] [-i COURSE_IDS] [-d DIR]
```
