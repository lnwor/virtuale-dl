# virtuale-dl

Extremely simple script to download every file of a course from https://virtuale.unibo.it

### Usage

The script needs the ID of the course, session cookies and the path where the
directory will be downloaded. You can either set them from command line with
options or editing the script directly.

```
Usage: ./virtuale-dl.sh [-c COOKIES] [-i ID_CORSI] [-d DIR]
```
